                    <p>Hi I'm Vita Fomin, I am currently studying to be fullstack software engineer. I have been working in the medical field for about 3 years now, and looking to make a career change to coding. I have been thinking about a career change for quite some time now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I worked quite a bit throughout the pandemic, and it wasn't until I realized that my job was taking a huge toll on my health. I started to get horrible headaches and experience dizziness. I knew then that I had been burnt out and over worked. Working in the medical field has been very rewarding, and I honestly loved every part of it. I just know now that it is time for me to take a big step and make that switch. Not beccaue I don't love it, but because I need prioratize my health over all.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I am very excited to start this new journey in my life, and can't wait to see where my coding takes me.   
                    </p>
